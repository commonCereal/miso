# miso
## Naming motivation
I'm a sucker for making clever abbreviations, so here's my motivation:
- Multi-threading is the concept.
- Dart's threads are called Isolates.
- So technically with respect to Dart, it'd be called multi-isolating
- Multi-ISOlating => MISO 🍜
- bonus: I happen to love miso ramen.
