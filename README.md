# miso

## Concurrent Programming with Dart
- Contains Isolate examples for Dart 2.15
- Will\* contain data structures for managing miso code.
- defines a totally cool term for Dart concurrent programming.

## Naming motivation
I'm a sucker for making clever abbreviations, so here's my motivation:
- Multi-threading is the concept.
- Dart's threads are called Isolates.
- So technically with respect to Dart, it'd be called multi-isolating
- Multi-ISOlating => MISO 🍜
- bonus: I happen to love miso ramen.
- QED -> I have the dumb


\* came about from a need in a personal project, though don't entirely need it atm so not doing too much in here until I need to. Just playing around for now.
